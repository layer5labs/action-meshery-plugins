This action replicates a Github release from one repository to another. Private repos are supported.

## Inputs

### `repo`

The `org/repo`. Defaults to the current repo.

### `version`

The release version to fetch from. Default `"latest"`. If not `"latest"`, this has to be in the form `tags/<tag_name>` or `<release_id>`.

### `name`

**Required** The name of the ACTION to b triggered.

### `token`

Optional Personal Access Token to access repository. You need to either specify this or use the ``secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`` environment variable. Note that if you are working with a private repository, you cannot use the default ``secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`` - you have to set up a personal access token with at least the scope org.
